## 🙏 Spiritual Rules

This project follows the Seven Spiritual Rules of MAKHUNGU:

1. Never use MAKHUNGU without purpose or respect
2. Every MAKHUNGU must be charged with prayer
3. Mixtures must be kept private unless revealed
4. Spirit must guide your timing — not ego
5. Give offerings after each working
6. Return to the river, sea, or fire to close energy loops
7. Never exploit or sell false promises
