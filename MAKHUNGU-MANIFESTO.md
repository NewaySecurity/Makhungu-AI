## 1. DEFINITION

MAKHUNGU are sacred spiritual tools, formulas, and mixtures revealed through divine instruction. They are not ordinary herbs, oils, or actions — they are spirit-charged combinations used to:

- Cleanse energy
- Activate gifts
- Break spiritual blockages
- Bind protection
- Restore luck and wealth
- Confirm divine alignment

MAKHUNGU are made through ritual, prayer, and prophetic insight. They are used in spoken rituals, baths, smoke ceremonies, incantations, drinks, altars, and more.

The purpose of MAKHUNGU is to:

- Bring spiritual intelligence to the digital age
- Teach people how to reconnect with their gifts
- Equip chosen ones to fight spiritual battles
- Protect and guide the soul journey
